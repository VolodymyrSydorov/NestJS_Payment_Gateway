# NestJS + Angular Payment Gateway - Step by Step Implementation Plan

## 📋 **Overview**
Building a full-stack payment gateway using NestJS backend + Angular frontend, integrating 5 different banks with unified API. Using **Super Minimal** approach - clean, focused setup from scratch.

---

## 🚀 **Phase 1: Minimal Foundation Setup**

### Step 1.1: Create NestJS Backend
- [ ] Create new NestJS application (`npx @nestjs/cli new backend`)
- [ ] Install basic dependencies (axios for HTTP calls)
- [ ] Set up basic project structure
- [ ] Configure CORS for frontend communication
- [ ] Test basic "Hello World" endpoint

### Step 1.2: Create Angular Frontend
- [ ] Create new Angular application (`npx @angular/cli new frontend`)
- [ ] Install Angular Material (`ng add @angular/material`)
- [ ] Configure Material theme and typography
- [ ] Set up basic routing and layout with Material components
- [ ] Configure HTTP client for backend communication
- [ ] Use Angular Signals for state management
- [ ] Test basic component rendering with Material design

### Step 1.3: Connect Frontend to Backend
- [ ] Set up proxy configuration for development
- [ ] Create basic service for API communication
- [ ] Test end-to-end connectivity (FE → BE)
- [ ] Verify both applications run simultaneously

## 🏗️ **Phase 2: Payment Gateway Architecture Implementation**

### Step 2.1: Shared Interfaces Setup ✅
- [x] Create shared interfaces directory (`shared/`)
- [x] Set up shared DTOs, interfaces, and enums:
  ```
  shared/
  ├── dto/                 # Shared Data Transfer Objects
  │   ├── charge.dto.ts
  │   └── payment-response.dto.ts
  ├── interfaces/          # Shared TypeScript interfaces
  │   ├── payment-processor.interface.ts
  │   └── payment-processor-factory.interface.ts
  ├── enums/               # Shared enums
  │   ├── payment-status.enum.ts
  │   ├── bank-id.enum.ts
  │   └── currency.enum.ts
  └── utils/               # Shared utilities
      └── validation.utils.ts
  ```
- [x] Configure TypeScript path mapping in both FE and BE (`@shared/*`)

### Step 2.2: Core Payment Module Structure
- [ ] Create payment module in NestJS backend (`backend/src/payment/`)
- [ ] Set up the directory structure using shared interfaces and backend-only mocks:
  ```
  backend/src/payment/
  ├── mocks/               # Mock services for simulating bank APIs
  │   ├── stripe-mock.service.ts
  │   ├── paypal-mock.service.ts
  │   ├── square-mock.service.ts
  │   ├── adyen-mock.service.ts
  │   ├── braintree-mock.service.ts
  │   └── mock.factory.ts
  ├── processors/          # Bank-specific processors using mocks
  │   ├── stripe.processor.ts
  │   ├── paypal.processor.ts
  │   ├── square.processor.ts
  │   ├── adyen.processor.ts
  │   └── braintree.processor.ts
  ├── factories/           # Processor factory
  │   └── payment-processor.factory.ts
  ├── processing.service.ts
  ├── payment.controller.ts
  └── payment.module.ts
  ```

### Step 2.2: Core Interfaces and DTOs
- [ ] Create `PaymentProcessor` interface
- [ ] Implement unified `ChargeDto` (request format)
- [ ] Implement unified `PaymentResponse` DTO
- [ ] Add validation decorators using class-validator
- [ ] Create bank-specific request/response types

### Step 2.3: Payment Processing Service
- [ ] Implement `ProcessingService` with unified `charge()` method
- [ ] Create `PaymentProcessorFactory` for dynamic bank selection
- [ ] Add error handling and custom exceptions
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring

---

## 🏦 **Phase 3: Bank Processors Implementation**

### Step 3.1: Mock Bank APIs (For Development)
- [ ] Create mock bank services for testing
- [ ] Set up 5 different mock bank APIs with unique formats:
  - Bank A: REST API with JSON
  - Bank B: SOAP/XML format
  - Bank C: Different JSON structure
  - Bank D: Custom headers and authentication
  - Bank E: GraphQL-based API
- [ ] Each bank should have different success/error response formats

### Step 3.2: Implement Bank Processors
- [ ] `BankAProcessor` - Implement first bank integration
- [ ] `BankBProcessor` - Implement second bank integration
- [ ] `BankCProcessor` - Implement third bank integration
- [ ] `BankDProcessor` - Implement fourth bank integration
- [ ] `BankEProcessor` - Implement fifth bank integration
- [ ] Each processor converts bank-specific responses to unified format

### Step 3.3: Factory and Service Integration
- [ ] Update `PaymentProcessorFactory` with all bank processors
- [ ] Register all processors in `PaymentModule`
- [ ] Test each bank processor individually
- [ ] Implement retry logic and timeout handling

## 🎨 **Phase 4: Angular Frontend Development**

### Step 4.1: Payment UI Components (Angular Material + Signals)
- [ ] Create payment dashboard component (`frontend/src/app/payment/`)
- [ ] Create payment form with Material components + Signals:
  - [ ] Material Select for bank selection (signal-driven)
  - [ ] Material Input for amount (signal-driven)
  - [ ] Material Button for submit
- [ ] Create payment result component with Material Cards
- [ ] Use Material Progress Bar for loading states (signal-driven)
- [ ] Implement responsive design with Material Layout
- [ ] Use signals for component state management

### Step 4.2: Payment Flow Implementation
- [ ] Material Select dropdown for 5 banks (Bank A, B, C, D, E)
- [ ] Material Form with validation (amount, currency)
- [ ] Material Progress indicators during processing
- [ ] Material Snackbar for status messages
- [ ] Material Cards for transaction results (success/failure)

### Step 4.3: Integration with Backend
- [ ] Create Angular payment service with signals
- [ ] Implement HTTP client for payment API calls (`POST /api/payment/charge`)
- [ ] Use signals for reactive state management:
  - [ ] `isLoading` signal for processing state
  - [ ] `paymentResult` signal for results
  - [ ] `error` signal for error handling
- [ ] Display payment results from backend response
- [ ] Reactive UI updates using signal effects

## 📊 **Success Criteria**

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Single `ProcessingService.charge()` method handles all banks
- [ ] Unified request/response format across all banks
- [ ] All 5 banks integrated with different API formats
- [ ] Basic error handling for all scenarios

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Users can select any of 5 banks for payment
- [ ] Payment status is clearly communicated
- [ ] Payment processing works for all 5 bank formats
- [ ] Graceful error handling and user feedback

## 🔧 **Development Tools and Commands**

### Development Environment
```bash
# Start development environment
npm run pm2-full:dev:start

# Run tests
npm run test
npm run test:e2e

# Build for production
npm run build

# Stop development environment
npm run pm2-full:dev:stop
```

### Key Files to Monitor
- `backend/src/payment/` - Backend payment logic
- `frontend/src/app/payment/` - Frontend payment UI
- `backend/package.json` - Backend dependencies
- `frontend/package.json` - Frontend dependencies

---

## 📝 **Notes**
- Start with Phase 1 to ensure boilerplate is working perfectly
- Use mock APIs initially for faster development
- Focus on clean architecture and maintainable code
- Prioritize user experience in frontend design
- Keep it simple - focus on core functionality
- Manual testing will be sufficient for demonstration
